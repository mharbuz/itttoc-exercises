<font color="blue">Set of odd, natural numbers.</font>
1. $`\{x \ldots, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4 \ldots \}`$<br>
<font color="blue">Set of even, integer numbers.</font>
1. $`\{n \mid n = 2m~\text{for some \textit{m}} \in \mathbb{N} \}`$<br>
<font color="blue">Set of even, natural numbers.</font>
1. $`\{n \mid n = 2m~\text{for some \textit{m}} \in \mathbb{N}, \text{and}~n~=~3k~\text{for some}~k \in \mathbb{N} \}`$<br>
<font color="blue">Set of even, natural numbers that are also multiples of 3.</font>
1. $`\{w \mid w~ \text{is a string of \textit{0s} and \textit{1s} and \textit{w} equals the reverse of}~w\}`$<br>
<font color="blue">Set of strings of 0s and 1s that are palindroms </font>
1. $`\{ n \mid n~\text{is an integer and}~ n = n+1\}`$<br>
<font color="blue">Set of integers that are equal to their successor which is <u>empty set</u></font>
## 0.2
Write  formal descriptions  of the following sets.
1. The set containing the numbers 1, 10, and 100<br>
    $`\{1, 10, 100\}`$
1. The set containing all integers that are greater than 5<br>
    $`\{n \mid n > 5, n \in \mathbb{Z}\}`$
1.  The set containing all natural numbers that are less than 5:<br>
    $`\{n \mid n < 5, n \in \mathbb{N}\}`$
1. The set containing the string "aba":<br>
    $`\{"aba"\}`$
1. The set containing the empty string:<br>
    $`\{\epsilon\}`$
1. The set containing nothing at all:<br>
    $`\emptyset`$
## 0.3
Let $A$ be the set $`\{x,y,z\}`$ and $B$ be the set $`\{x,y\}`$
1. Is $A$ a subset of $B$? ($A \subseteq B$) <br>
    No, $A$ is not a subset of $B$
1. Is $B$ a subset of $A$? ($B \subseteq A$) <br>
    Yes, $B$ is a subset of $A$
1. What is the union of $A$ and $B$? ($A \cup B$) <br>
    $`\{x,y,z\} = A`$
1. What is the intersection of $A$ and $B$? ($A \cap B$) <br>
    $`\{x,y\} = B`$
1. What is the cross product $A$ and $B$? ($A \times B$) <br>
    $`\{(x,x), (x,y), (y,x), (y,y), (z,x), (z,y)\}`$
1. What is the power set of $B$? ($\mathcal{P}(B)$) <br>
    $`\{\emptyset, \{x\}, \{y\}, \{x,y\}\}`$

## 0.4
If $A$ has  $a$  elements and  $B$  has  $b$  elements, how many elements are in  $A \times B$? 
Explain your answer.<br><br>
The cross product of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of all possible ordered pairs of elements from $A$ and $B$. If $A$ has $a$ elements and $B$ has $b$ elements, then the cross product $A \times B$ will have $a \cdot b$ elements.

## 0.5
If $C$ is a set with $c$ elements, how many elements are in the power set of $C$? 
Explain your answer.<br><br>
The power set of a set $C$ is the set of all possible subsets of $C$. If $C$ has $c$ elements, then the power set of $C$ will have $2^c$ elements.
