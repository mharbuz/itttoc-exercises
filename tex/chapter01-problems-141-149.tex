            For languages $A$ and $B$,let the \textbf{perfect shuffle} of $A$ and $B$ be the language $\{w~|~ w = a_1b_1\ldots a_kb_k , \text{where} a_1\ldots a_k \in A \text{and} b_1 \ldots b_k \in B, each a_i,b_i \in \Sigma\}$. Show that the class of regular languages is closed under perfect shuffle.

            Let $A$ and $B$ be regular languages. Then there exist DFAs $M_A$ and $M_B$ that accept $A$ and $B$, respectively. We construct a DFA $M$ that accepts the perfect shuffle of $A$ and $B$.

            Let $M_A = (Q_A,\Sigma,\delta_A,q_{0A},F_A)$ and $M_B = (Q_B,\Sigma,\delta_B,q_{0B},F_B)$. Let $Q = Q_A \times Q_B$, $q_0 = (q_{0A},q_{0B})$, and $F = F_A \times F_B$. The transition function $\delta$ is defined as follows: for each $q \in Q$ and $a \in \Sigma$, $\delta(q,a) = (\delta_A(q_A,a),\delta_B(q_B,a))$.

            We claim that $L(M) = A \circ B$. Let $w = a_1b_1\ldots a_kb_k \in A \circ B$. Then there exists a sequence of states $r_0,r_1,\ldots,r_k$ such that $r_0 = q_0$, $r_k \in F$, and $\delta(r_{i-1},a_i) = r_i$ for $i = 1,\ldots,k$. Let $r_i = (r_{iA},r_{iB})$. Then $r_{iA} \in Q_A$ and $r_{iB} \in Q_B$. Since $r_k \in F$, $r_{kA} \in F_A$ and $r_{kB} \in F_B$. Thus $a_1\ldots a_k \in A$ and $b_1\ldots b_k \in B$. Therefore $w \in A \circ B$.

            Conversely, let $w = a_1\ldots a_kb_1\ldots b_k \in A \circ B$. Then $a_1\ldots a_k \in A$ and $b_1\ldots b_k \in B$. Let $r_i = (r_{iA},r_{iB})$ for $i = 0,\ldots,k$. Then $r_0 = q_0$, $r_k \in F$, and $\delta(r_{i-1},a_i) = r_i$ for $i = 1,\ldots,k$. Therefore $w \in L(M)$.


      \item [1.42]

            For languages $A$ and $B$, let the \textbf{shuffle} of $A$ and $B$ be the language $\{w~|~ w = a_1b_1\ldots a_kb_k, where a_1 \ldots a_k \in A \text{and} b_1 \ldots b_k \in B\text{, each }a_i,b_i \in \Sigma^\ast\}$. Show that the class of regular languages is closed under \textbf{shuffle}.

      \item [1.43]

            Let $A$ be any language. Define $\text{DROP-OUT}(A)$ to be the language containing all strings that can be obtained by removing one symbol from a string in $A$. Thus,

            $\text{DROP-OUT}(A)=\{xz ~|~ xyz \in A~ \text{where}~ x,z \in \Sigma^\ast,y \in \Sigma\}$.

            Show that the class of regular languages is closed under the $\text{DROP-OUT}$ operation. Give both a proof by picture and a more formal proof by construction as in Theorem 1.47.

      \item [1.44]
      Let $B$ and $C$ be languages over $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$. Define $B \xleftarrow[]{1} C = \{w \in B~| ~\text{for some} y \in C, \text{strings}~ w~ \text{and}~ y~ \text{contain equal numbers of }1\text{s}\}$. Show that the class of regular languages is closed under the $\xleftarrow[]{1}$ operation.
