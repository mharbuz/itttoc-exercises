          Read the informal definition of the finite state transducer given in Exercise 1.24. Give the state diagram of an FST with the following behavior. Its input and output alphabets are $\{0,1\}$. Its output string is identical to the input string on the even positions but inverted on the odd positions. For example, on input $0000111$ it should output $1010010$.
