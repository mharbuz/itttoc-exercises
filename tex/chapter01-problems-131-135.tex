          For any string $w = w_1w_2\ldots w_n$, the reverse of $w$, written $w^R$, is the string $w$ in reverse order, $w_n \ldots w_2w_1$. For any language A, let $A^R = \{w^R ~|~ w \in A\}$. Show that if $A$ is regular, so is $A^R$.

          Let $$D = \{Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F\}$$ be DFA recognizes $A$. We will construct a NFA $$D^R = \{Q^R, \Sigma, \delta^R, q^R_0, \{q_0\}\}$$ that recognizes $A^R$.

          $Q^R = Q \cup \{q^R_0\}$ where $q^R_0$ is new starting state connected with $\epsilon$-edges/transitions to each accepting state of $Q$ from $F$  \\
          $F^R = \{q_0\}$ (starting state from $D$ is accepting state of $D'$) \\
          $\delta^R(q, a) = \{p ~|~ \delta(p, a) = q\}$ \\
          and $\delta^R(q^R_0, \epsilon) = F$.
