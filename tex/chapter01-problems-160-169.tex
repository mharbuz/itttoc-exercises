            Let $\Sigma =\{a,b\}$. For each $k \ge 1$, let $C_k$ be the language consisting of all strings that contain an a exactly $k$ places from the right-hand end. Thus $C_k = \Sigma^\ast a \Sigma^{k-1}$. Describe an NFA with $k+1$ states that recognizes $C_k$ in terms of both a state diagram and a formal description.
